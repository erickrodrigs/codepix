# CodePix

CodePix is an example of Pix transaction method implemented with microservices architectural style. It was carried out in "Imers√£o Full-Stack && Full-Cycle" by Wesley Willians - creator of School of Net and many other companies.
The Project's purpose is to study some concepts and patterns of Microservices architectural style, as well as Hexagonal architectural model and new languages/technologies such as GoLang, Apache Kafka and Nest.js

## Microservices

* CodePix: Made with GoLang, Apache Kafka, Grpc and following Hexagonal (Port-Adapters) architectural model
* Bank: Made with Nest.js framework for Node.js

## Languages

* Go (for CodePix microservice)
* Javascript (for other microservices and frontend)

## Technologies

* Docker/Kubernetes
* Apache Kafka
* GRPC
* Postgres
* Nest.js (for backend)
* Next.js (for frontend)
